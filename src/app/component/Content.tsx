        Shiksha Mahakumbh is the brainchild of Dr. Thakur SKR, a prominent ISRO
        scientist and staunch RSS worker, which took shape under the able
        guidance of Mr. Vijay Kumar Nadda, a visionary and forward-looking RSS
        Pracharak and Organising Secretary of Vidya Bharti &#40;North Zone&#41;. The
        inaugural edition of Shiksha Mahakumbh i.e., National Conference on
        Recent Advances in School Education &#40;RASE 2023&#41; was organised by
        Sarvhitkari Educational Society, a prominent unit of Vidya Bharti &#45;Akhil
        Bhartiya Shiksha Sansthan in the state of Punjab, in collaboration with
        Dr. B. R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology Jalandhar. The
        conference was held from June 9 to 11, 2023, at the esteemed premises of
        Dr. B. R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar. During
        the campaign of Shiksha Mahakumbh, the voice of conducting this very
        massive and innovative event annually in collaboration with Institutions
        of National Importance arose. Several Directors of these Institutions
        and Vice-Chancellors of Central Universities demanded its next edition
        in their Institutions. Accordingly, the matter was discussed within the
        committee of this mass movement and it&#39;s decided to book its first 5
        editions in collaboration with these Institutions of National
        Importance. When the agreement of its 2nd edition was signed between
        Department of Holistic Education, the originating place of this mass
        movement and Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, the news spread
        across the country. Thereafter several other Universities demanded for
        its editions in their institutions. Then the managing committee decided
        to launch its another franchise i.e., Shiksha Kumbh. Accordingly, the
        mass movement translated into Shiksha Mahakumbh &#45; an annual event for
        the entire globe and Shiksha Kumbh &#45; an annual event for field-specific
        participants of the globe. The foremost objective of Shiksha Mahakumbh
        is to cultivate an environment conducive to the effective implementation
        of the National Education Policy 2020 &#40;NEP&#41;. Moreover, this conference
        franchise aspires to congregate and facilitate the exchange of insights
        and research findings among distinguished academic scientists,
        researchers, research scholars, and industry experts, encompassing all
        facets of school and higher education. This endeavor, spearheaded by the
        Department of Holistic Education of Vidya Bharti, is unparalleled on a
        global scale, aiming to annually unite the 26.5 Crore school students
        and 4.25 Crore college&#58;university students from across Bharat on a
        single platform to decide the direction of Bhartiya Education in a
        similar fashion as was the practice in ancient Bharat. It achieves this
        laudable goal through its collaboration with Institutions of National
        Importance. Shiksha Mahakumbh is managed by the Event Management Cell of
        the Department of Holistic Education, which is a new generation Think
        Tank of Vidya Bharti.

        The Department of Holistic Education is the brainchild of Dr. Thakur SKR
        who is a distinguished scientist of ISRO, a dedicated social worker and
        an accomplished author. The foundation of DHE is based on the ideology
        that the level of education should not be gauged by academic scores
        alone. Rather, in true essence, education should aim at holistic
        development of children and should be multi-disciplinary focusing on
        skill development, physical fitness, emotional well being and
        development of strong ethics in students. Holistic education will
        transform young minds into not only professionally skilled adults but
        also responsible individuals who are an asset for the nation. Keeping
        pace with the technology driven world, there is an imperative need of
        integration of technology with value-based education. Considering the
        present lacunae and the dynamically evolving landscape of education, the
        structure of DHE has been designed to effectively bridge the gaps in
        present education system to make it more effective. At present, DHE has
        25 dedicated cells- IT Cell, Industry Coordination Cell, Learning
        Management System Cell, CSR Cell, R&D Cell, Entrepreneurship Cell,
        Foreign Language Cell, Atal Tinkering Labs, Environment Cell, Sports
        Cell etc catering to various aspects of education system with dedicated
        co-ordinators to lead these cells. Exhaustive research and development
        is carried out prior to running pilot projects and implementing them in
        schools and society. Since inception, the Department has multiple
        revolutionary projects- E-cycle, Punjab Super 100, Tredul App, Sarvatr
        App, Swadeshi bazaar App, TUDU App. Jobs360o App, Surbhi Diye, Surbhi
        Piggy Bag, Surbhi Flower Pot, etc. to its credit. The department has
        successfully organised mass outreach events viz Shiksha Mahakumbh at NIT
        Jalandhar and Shiksha Kumbh at NIT Kurukshetra which were attended by
        dignitaries and stakeholders from all fields – viz politics,
        bureaucracy, educational stalwarts, corporate houses, media and speakers
        from all domains. DHE has also launched its quarterly journal “Viksit
        India” which offers comprehensive coverage of a multitude of educational
        aspects, from school education to higher education, language pedagogy to
        technological advancements, child pedagogy to scientific research and
        explores the realms of ever-evolving domain of education. With the same
        vigour and enthusiasm, the Department is gearing up for organisation of
        Shiksha Kumbh at NIT Srinagar and Shiksha Mahakumbh at IIT Ropar along
        with launch of various innovative projects- One child one hour work per
        day, Recycling of cloths, paper & plastic, One school one product,
